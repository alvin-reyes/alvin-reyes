Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Alvin**, I'm an Tech Entrep, product manager, full stack developer, devops and web3 technologist trying to make a positive dent with what I do best: tech/coding. I love open source software. I love building useful solution. I love solving customer problems, I love improving stuff. I love innovation.

More than a decade of experience in the Software Engineering field. Worked at HP, Oracle, IBM, Macquarie Group and ScotiaBank. Led technology teams, built/design enterprise solutions, started / built / building / sustaining / exited ventures but will always be a developer at heart.
