Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Alvin**, I'm an Tech Entrep, product manager, full stack developer, devops and web3 technologist trying to make a positive dent with what I do best: tech/coding. I love open source software. I love building useful solution. I love solving customer problems, I love improving stuff. I love innovation.

More than 10 years experience in the Software Engineering field. I had the privilege of working at HP, Oracle, IBM, Macquarie Group and ScotiaBank.

I have moved to Web3 and currently trying my best to build the future of web infrastructure at [@protocollabs](https://protocol.ai/)
